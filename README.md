# Context & Description

For this evidence, I have chosen to work with a Leetcode problem using the Logic Paradigm and Prolog Language. I chose to work with Leetcode because, in my experience, companies more often than not choose to use this kind of problems for interviews.

I will be working on the problem '350. Intersection of two arrays II', which states the following:

Given that Leetcode doesn't work with prolog language, the platform won't verify my answer, but I will work with the same test cases to prove that my code works.
