# Context & Description

For this evidence, I have chosen to work with a Leetcode problem using the Logic Paradigm and Prolog Language. I chose to work with Leetcode because, in my experience, companies more often than not choose to use this kind of problems for interviews.

Given that Leetcode doesn't work with prolog language, the platform won't verify my answer, but I will work with the same test cases to prove that my code works.
